# STM32 Hardware Repo for the Acoustic Collar Project

*NOTE: This repository is heavily based on [rkwhitlock/acoustic-species-hardware](https://github.com/rkwhitlock/acoustic-species-hardware/tree/main) and builds on the work of Reese Whitlock, Kruti Dharanipathi, Ben Scott, and co.*

This repository contains an optimized embedded hardware implementation of the burrowing owl TinyML classifier (described in the [software repo](https://github.com/ZhenmanShen/CSE145-237D-ML/)) for the **STM32H747I-DISCO** development board.
